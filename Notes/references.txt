Review:

- Express

In the world of programming and coding, "Express" refers to Express.js, 
	which is a popular web application framework for Node.js. 
It is used for building web applications and APIs. 
Express is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and scalability, 
	allowing developers to quickly create robust server-side applications. 
It provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, 
	without obscuring Node.js features, 
		and it has a wide range of plugins and extensions for extended functionality.

- Markdown 

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax, 
    widely used in the blogging and coding communities. 
It's designed to be easy to write and read in its raw form, 
    making it an efficient way to write content for the web without needing to know HTML.

Here's why Markdown is popular:

1. Simplicity: Its syntax is straightforward, making it easy for anyone to learn and use, even those without programming experience.
2. Readability: Markdown documents are readable as plain text but can be converted into HTML or other formats.
3. Flexibility: It's compatible with many blogging and content management systems, 
                    and it's often used for README files on GitHub and other development platforms.
4. Control: Markdown allows you to control the formatting of your text without the complexity of HTML tags.

Common elements in Markdown include headers, lists, emphasis (like bold and italics), links, and code blocks. 
    For instance, to create a header, you use # before your header text. 
        For a list, you can use asterisks or numbers. 
            The simplicity and effectiveness of Markdown make it a favorite among bloggers, developers, and content creators.
