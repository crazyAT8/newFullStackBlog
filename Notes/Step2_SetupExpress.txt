[2:57] - Setup Express

- code the server 
    + variable for express 
    + app variable 
    + app listens to a port number

            const express = required('express');
            const app = express();

            app.listen(5000);

        unfortunately you will get an 'unfound'
            bc the route isn't setup yet
