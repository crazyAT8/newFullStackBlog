Styling with Bootstrap [11:10]

[12:38]
To be able and go through each one of our articles 
    if we add <% %>
        we can still add code btw the percent signs 
        without the = equal sign 
            it just won't be outputted to the page

        <% articles.forEach(article => { %>
            <div class="card mt-4">
                <%= article.title %>
            </div>
        <% }) %>

        this loops over all of our articles
            'Test Article'
                as seen on the screen 
                is from the server.js file

Test by adding another article to the articles class 
    called test article 2

    const articles = [{
        title: 'Test Article',
        createdAt: Date.now(),
        description: 'Test description'
    },
    {
        title: 'Test Article 2',
        createdAt: Date.now(),
        description: 'Test description 2'
    }]

    you should see see it in your browser

    But we need to add more then the title
