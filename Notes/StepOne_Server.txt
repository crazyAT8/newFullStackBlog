1) Setup Server

type: 'npm init -y'
    in our console
        gives us a boiler plate package.json

- add dependencies
type: 'npm i express mongoose ejs'
    express is for our server
    mongoose is for our database
    ejs is for our different view
        get a 
            node_modules folder
            package-lock.json

- install dev dependencies
type: 'npm i --save-dev nodemon'
    nodemon allows us to automatically refresh our page everytime
    we make a change to our code 
        add this '"devStart": "nodemon server.js"'
        to the "scripts curly braces in the packages.json file

- create a server.js file 
type: 'npm run devStart'

- code the server 
    + variable for express 
    + app variable 
    + app listens to a port number
        unfortunately you will get an 'unfound'
            bc the route isn't setup yet 
    + set up route 
        attach app variable to a GET function

    + Need to get it so that it sends HTML to the screen
        bc just sending text isn't that useful
            Need to set out 'view enginge'
            app.set('view engine', 'ejs')
                we want it set to ejs bc we are going to be writing all of our views with ejs
                and our view engine is going to convert that to HTML
                    + Create a folder 'Views'
                        with a file entitled 'index.ejs'
