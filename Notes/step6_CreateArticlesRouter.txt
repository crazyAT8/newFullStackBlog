[7:40] - Create Articles Router 

- Server.js 

    but we also need to tell our article router
        where it's going to be based on
            we do this by providing a file path in the parameter

        app.use('/articles', articleRouter)

        now whats going to happen is that 
        every single route we create in this article router 
            is going to be added to the end of the slash articles

- articles.js 

    router.get('/', (req, res) => {
        res.send('In articles')
    })

    you may think that by using our slash route 
        it's going to render in articles but 
        only the HTML we are sending from the server is appearing

    need to add a /articles at the end of URL
        and you will see the 'In articles'
    
    so everything in articles.js 
        will be relative to that path
