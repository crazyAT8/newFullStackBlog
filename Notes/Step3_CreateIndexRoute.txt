[3:33] - Create Index Route 

    + set up route 
        attach app variable to a GET function

        app.get('/', (req, res) => {
            res.send('Hello World')
        })

        the slash is just our index route or main route
        and take a request as well as a response
        and for now we will
            send to the user with our response dot send
            the text 'Hello World'

    - refresh the screen and we can see the message 'Hello World'

    + Need to get it so that it sends HTML to the screen
        bc just sending text isn't that useful
            Need to set out 'view enginge'

            app.set('view engine', 'ejs')

                we want it set to ejs bc we are going to be writing all of our views with ejs
                and our view engine is going to convert that to HTML
    
    + Create a folder 'Views'
        with a file entitled 'index.ejs'
            where you setup a boiler plate HTML page 
            and write some test text inside the body tags 

    - server.js 
        in the app.get function 
        instead of .send 
            we want to call render 
                this is going to access our views folder 
                and we pass it the path to the view we want 
                which in our case is just called 'index'

                app.get('/', (req, res) => {
                    res.render('index')
                })

    - save and refresh the page 
        you should see the test text in the Local browser
