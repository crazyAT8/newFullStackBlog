[6:39] - Export Articles Router

- articles.js 

    first setup express with a variable
        then
    create a router variable
        that equals express.Router()
        Router called as a function 
            this is going to give us a router we can use 
            to create views like the app.get .render 
                attach a get function to the router variable 
                and pass in a slash 

                    const express = require('express');
                    const router = express.Router();

                    router.get('/')

                the main thing about this router is 
                    that we have to tell our application to 
                        use this router 
                so we need to export this router
                    from our articles 
                        so get rid of the router.get and add 
                            module.exports = router

                    const express = require('express');
                    const router = express.Router();

                    module.exports = router

                and now where ever we require this file 
                we can actually read in this router 

- server.js 
    we can just require our router 

        const articleRouter = require('./routes/articles)

    now we just need to tell our app to use that router 

        app.use(articleRouter)
